## Description
Our app will allow users to search solely for restaurants with food/drink happy hours deals, displaying restaurant name, location, happy hour prices, and happy hour hours. Our users would be anyone who likes paying less for high-quality food and/or enjoys lower-priced drinks with their meals. Our main features would be a search bar, a favorites list, a list of restaurants that match the search in the area, and descriptions of each restaurant. 

What we'll use: Zomato API, React
